# Rainfall-Prediction-model
🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using LSTM and Weather Data API
This project aims to predict rainfall using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on historical weather data. It integrates live weather data from a Weather API and leverages deep learning for time-series forecasting.

📌 Project Overview
Rainfall forecasting is vital for agriculture, disaster management, and water resource planning. This project uses:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series prediction.

Weather Data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) for real-time or historical weather information.
